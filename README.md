## Peer Comment (Hyunjun Choi)

    - The article manifests fascinating essence about building custom software from a business point of view. One can easily agree with the gists mentioned by the author. However, there are some unresolved questions in the script. From the article, a firm requests custom software from a custom software development company, then what's the cost of ordering the software? How could the firm manage the software problems after acquiring its custom software? Will the firm need to hire developers to maintain the software from glitches? Would the firm pay a constant service fee to the development company to uphold the software from working properly? What's the actual estimated net cost including developer hiring and/or service fee?
